There are two kinds of 'definition' we need to consider in category theory.
1) An object of type X is a Y if ....
2) An object X is a structure comprised of so and so...

To 1) correspond propositions and to 2) records.

Thus it makes no sense to a say a Functor or a Natural Transformation is a X such that....
But we can say that an object T is a category C is a terminal object if such and such....

Hegel's Logic, Type Theory, Logic, Category Theory and Software.
===============================================================

The profound duality between initial and terminal objects.
The initial object, Nichts,  the empty set, the empty type, Empty_Set, False,  through contradiction generates
everything (ex falso): the limit of a diagram from empty category the terminal object.
The terminal object, Sein, the singleton, identity, Truth. Limits terminal cones.
Types from the empty type can be inhabited just as there are functions from the empty set.
The initial category and terminal category.
Constructing in Coq a category with two objects and only identity arrows (for products via terminal cones):
what a profound interplay between the empty type and singletons, and identity through induction.
Induction is everything.
In Plato's Sophist there is a perplexity over falsehood.
Non-existent beings or predicates and false propositions. Same paradox of an empty type.
The singleton, terminal object, Truth, is also the One. The one identifies all, creates identity from being (inhabitation).
The core concepts in Plato's dialogues such as Being, One, Truth, Sameness can be seen from the perspective of type theory, logic
and category theory

Tabak - Plato's Parmenides reconsidered. Contra Proclus:  It is the Sophist not the dialectical section of the Parmenides (which illustrates sophistical fallacies) that
should be considered the definite mature expression of Plato's theory.

In the Sophist we deal with the categories of Being (terminal object, Type), Non-Being (initial object), Unity (singleton), Whole, Parts (exponentials), Sameness, Difference, 
Participation.  In the first section of the Parmenides
we have the Type Hierarchy (the third man).

Sophist 237

Propositions, Types, Sets, Fibred Category = ontology

This section is about non-being, the empty type, falsity.

Predication is inhabitation.   Or reference is inhabitation.   The ex falso quodlibet paradox. To reasoning about a type
one must assume the type is inhabited. And this being so anything can be deduced through law of contradiction (in natural deduction).

Talking about non-being =  assuming non-being is inhabited.  

243 - 246 Key passage to analyse

the universe is one.  What is 'is' ? 

Being (Set. Type ? ), One (Terminal Object), Universe (Set, Type ?).  Names with references.

Can Being be a singleton type  with One : Being ?   But also One : One ?

Two names for the same thing ? Or two tokens with same reference ? Or non-uniqueness of types ?

But plurality of 'names exist'.  Cf. names phi : X -> Omega in topos theory.

Name = Reference.

forall x, exists y, Name(x,y) and Name (y) and Meaning (y, x).

if forall x, x = one, then Name (x,y) => x = y. Name of a name. One a name and a name of a name.
But there remains the duality between name and reference.

"This expression".
