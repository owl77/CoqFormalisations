There are two kinds of 'definition' we need to consider in category theory.
1) An object of type X is a Y if ....
2) An object X is a structure comprised of so and so...

To 1) correspond propositions and to 2) records.

Thus it makes no sense to a say a Functor or a Natural Transformation is a X such that....
But we can say that an object T is a category C is a terminal object if such and such....

Hegel's Logic, Type Theory, Logic, Category Theory and Software.
===============================================================

The profound duality between initial and terminal objects.
The initial object, Nichts,  the empty set, the empty type, Empty_Set, False,  through contradiction generates
everything (ex falso): the limit of a diagram from empty category the terminal object.
The terminal object, Sein, the singleton, identity, Truth. Limits terminal cones.
Types from the empty type can be inhabited just as there are functions from the empty set.
The initial category and terminal category.
Constructing in Coq a category with two objects and only identity arrows (for products via terminal cones):
what a profound interplay between the empty type and singletons, and identity through induction.
Induction is everything.
In Plato's Sophist there is a perplexity over falsehood.
Non-existent beings or predicates and false propositions. Same paradox of an empty type.
